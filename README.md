<h1 id="cloning-mints-sign-up-form">Cloning Mint’s sign up form</h1>
<p>Second project of the <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> curriculum from the CSS3 and HTML section.</p>
<p>In this project, we got to rebuild the form used by <a href="http://www.mint.com/">Mint.com</a> for signing up new users. They have been highly praised for the design and simplicity of their site, and their signup process is very clean.</p>
